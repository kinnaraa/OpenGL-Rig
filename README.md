This is a simple robot arm rig made using OpenGL with C++. The arm was made using a graph heirarchy of Nodes consisting of a base, top, 2 arms connected by a joint, and a "pen" at the tip. I have also generated lighting for the rig and created functionality for shooting a projectile from the tip of the "pen". The robot arm also moves to the position of the projectile upon impact with the ground plane. The rig can be used as described below:

Press C to select the camera and arrow keys to move the camera.

Press B to select the base and the left and right arrow keys to move it from side to side.

Press T to select the top and the left and right arrow keys to rotate it.

Press 1 or 2 to select either Arm 1 or 2 and use the up and down arrow keys to rotate them.

Press P to select the pen and any arrow keys to rotate it. Press Shift + left/right arrow keys to rotate about its own axis.

Press S to shoot a projectile from the tip of the pen.
