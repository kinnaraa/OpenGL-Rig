# OpenGL-Rig
Rig of a basic robot arm structure containing a base, top, two arms seperated by a joint, and a "pen" at the end. This was done by crearing a graph heirarchy of nodes that effect one another. I also generated lighting for the rig using two different colored lights. Instructions for use are in the README.
